/**
 * Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns node at the beginning of the loop
 *
 * DEFINITION: Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a nodeâ€™s next pointer points to an earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list
 *
 * E.g.
 * Input: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C [the same C as earlier] Output: C
 *
 * If we move two pointers, one with speed 1 and another with speed 2, they will end up meet- ing if the linked list has a loop
 *
 * We know:
 * 1 Head is k nodes from LoopStart (by definition)
 * 2 MeetingPoint for n1 and n2 is k nodes from LoopStart (as shown above)
 *
 * Thus, if we move n1 back to Head and keep n2 at MeetingPoint, and move them both at the same pace, they will meet at LoopStart
