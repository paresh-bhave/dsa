/**
 * There are 100 different types of caps each having a unique id from 1 to 100. Also, there are ‘n’ persons each having a collection of a variable
 * number of caps. One day all of these persons decide to go in a party wearing a cap but to look unique they decided that none of them will wear the
 * same type of cap. So, count the total number of arrangements or ways such that none of them is wearing the same type of cap.
 *
 * Constraints: 1 <= n <= 10 Example:
 *
 * Input:
 * 3
 * 5 100 1     // Collection of the first person.
 * 2           // Collection of the second person.
 * 5 100       // Collection of the third person.
 *
 * Output:
 * 4
 * Explanation: All valid possible ways are (5, 2, 100),  (100, 2, 5),
 * (1, 2, 5) and  (1, 2, 100)
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Solution:
 *
 * Let i be the current cap number (caps from 1 to i-1 are already
 * processed). Let integer variable mask indicates that the persons w
 * earing and not wearing caps.  If i'th bit is set in mask, then
 * i'th person is wearing a cap, else not.
 *
 * // consider the case when ith cap is not included
 * // in the arrangement
 * countWays(mask, i) = countWays(mask, i+1) +
 * // when ith cap is included in the arrangement
 * // so, assign this cap to all possible persons
 * // one by one and recur for remaining persons.
 * ∑ countWays(mask | (1 << j), i+1)
 * for every person j that can wear cap i
 * Note that the expression "mask | (1 << j)" sets j'th bit in mask.
 * And a person can wear cap i if it is there in the person's cap list
 * provided as input.
