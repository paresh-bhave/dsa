/**
 * Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
 *   Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
 *   Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
 *   Example 2:
 *
 *   Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
 *   Output: [[1,5]]
 *   Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
 *
 *   NOTE: input types have been changed on April 15, 2019. Please reset to default code definition to get new method signature.

/**
 * An efficient approach is to first sort the intervals according to the starting time. Once we have the sorted intervals, we can combine all intervals in a linear traversal. The idea is, in sorted array of intervals, if interval[i] doesnâ€™t overlap with interval[i-1], then interval[i+1] cannot overlap with interval[i-1] because starting time of interval[i+1] must be greater than or equal to interval[i]. Following is the detailed step by step algorithm.
 *
 *
 * Algorith:
 * 1. Sort the intervals based on increasing order of starting time.
 * 2. Push the first interval on to a stack.
 * 3. For each interval do the following
 *   a. If the current interval does not overlap with the stack top, push it.
 *   b. If the current interval overlaps with stack top and ending
 *     time of current interval is more than that of stack top,
 *     update stack top with the ending  time of current interval.
 * 4. At the end stack contains the merged intervals.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
